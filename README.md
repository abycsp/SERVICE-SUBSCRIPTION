# SERVICE-SUBSCRIPTION
The service subscription system aims to develop a program that will use the
modules of data structures and algorithms and will be able to apply it to our
program. Since our program is all about the service subscription, the goal of our
group is to develop a program that will enable our users to choose their
subscription plans from our three different products which are Netflix, HBO, and
Amazon prime video. The user of the program can choose a product and their
desired plan which can be seen at the beginning of the program. After choosing a
subscription plan, the program will lead you to the contract and agreement part
and will ask for the user to fill up the necessary information and if the user will
agree or not, if not then the program will exit. If the user chose yes, then it will
lead to the payment part of the program then to the integration of dummy payment
afterwards to management of product or service offer to the last part which is the
customer care. The flow of the program will use the different implementation of
data structures and algorithms for every flow of our program including the array
and arraylist in every module/flow of our program.
